                <h3>French and Indian War</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: 1754-1763.</p>
                <p1>North American Battleground for Seven Years War.</p1>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Cause</span>: As George Washington is sent out to lay claims on the disputed Ohio Territory, his troops engaged in skirmishes with the French, which snowballed into the French and Indian War.</p>
                <p>This is the first major war for the American colonists. They gained confidence and unity as they fought alongside the British Redcoats.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: Under the leadership of William Pitt, Britain and the Colonies was able to win the war. In addition, the resulting Treaty of Paris eradicated French influence in North America after they ceded their territory to the British.</p>
                <p>It helped shape the American identity as it was one of the first times where the American people joined forces and fought against a common enemy.</p>
                <p>Many lost their lives on the battlefield, and many others on the skirmishes at the frontier.</p>
