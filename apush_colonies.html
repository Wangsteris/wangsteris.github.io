                <h3>Thirteen Colonies</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: 1607-July 4, 1776.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Intent</span>: To establish a location where New World materials could be gathered, crops could be planted, and expand the British empire.</p>
                <p>In the early days of the Colonies, life was harsh and tough. Many of the vanguards died, and the survivors had to resort to cannibalism. However, gradually, the situation became better as the colonists learned to live off of the new land. This helped shape the American identity of resiliency</p>
                <p1>The British government's political acts such as the Intolerable Acts and their mercantilistpolicies led to animosity against the British in the colonies.</p1>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: Tired of the British abuses, the colonies united and declared their independence. They then engaged in a war with the British in the form of the Revolutionary War, which the Americans won with foreign aid from the French. However, during the war, there were two factions in the form of Patriots and Loyalists. This split in the American population and the fact that many American merchants were still dealing with the British made the victory even more special for the Americans.</p>
