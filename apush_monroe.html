                <h3>Roar of an Emerging Beast</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: December 2, 1823</p>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Intent</span>: To warn European powers and prevent them from interfering with the Americas.</p>
                <p>This was the symbol of the emerging American nationalist identity. Even though this wasn't an official doctrine but rather a statement or proposal of American foreign policy by the then President James Monroe, this demonstrates the spirit of the Americans at the time. In addition, it angered the old monarchs as the president of the young nation openly attempts to limit their power.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: Not much emerged from this doctrine. However, no European powers that were not already occupying territory in the Americas attempted to colonize or interfere. All in all, it gave the United States the responsibility to police the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>This doctrine was also consistent with the idea of Isolationism that was proposed by the Founding Father George Washington. This further solidifies the idea of American national identity as a nation that would engage in commerce but would rather not engage in warfare if possible. However, the United States was still weak militarily at the time, which angered Latin American states who didn't want to be subjected to American policies. However, European powers did respect the doctrine.</p>
