                <h3>Net Neutrality</h3>
                <p>The internet is a vital part of American society, and yet the FCC yearns to take away the free internet.</p>
                <p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a former layer for Verizon and an unelected official, has ordered for the repeal of the Obama Era internet protection lawas called Net Neutrality. What Net Neutrality does is that it made it illegal for ISPs to have "fast lanes" for websites that paid more money and throttle connection speed for the websites that did not paid. In addition, it prevents ISP's from packaging different types of websites and selling them to consumers.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p4>An example of a world without Net Neutrality. However, be warned that the prices will be way higher as ISPs will have a complete monopoly over the pricing.</p4>
                    <p4>Trust me, you do not want this.</p4>
                    <div class="box">

                    </div>
                    <p4>This the man that wants to take away our freedom.</p4>
                </div></center>
                <h3>FCC Scandals</h3>
                <p>Almost unanimously, internet users in the USA agree that Ajit Pai is a corrupt official that is a pupper of ISPs. Ajit Pai himself had even joked about being a puppet and mocked the American public for their stupidity for allowing this situation to occur.</p>
                <p>The FCC also stole the identity of millions of the American public to post false comments of support on their website, and they even refused to investigate when ordered to by the American public.</p>
                <p>ISPs also paid senators and representatives money to support the FCC through a system of legal bribery in our government called "Donations."</p>

                    </div>
                    <p4>See the corrupt Senators and Representatives that sold their entire state to the ISPs.</p4>
                </div></center>
                <p>This incident with Net Neutrality brings to light a great issue with the American government and American society.</p>
                <p>We have a system of legal bribery in place and our society is to brainwashed by the blitz and glammor of celebrities to truly be able to unite and make a difference.</p>
                <p>Besides, protesting would never work as well as it did before. These corrupt officials will merely sit in their air conditioned office and watch protestors brave the heat.</p>
                <p>Reforms are needed. The government has to go back to serving the people and not the top 1%.</p>
                <p>If nothing is done, then we are witnessing the dusk of the United States.</p>
