                <h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
                <p>With the advancements in technology such as facial recognition, surveilance of others has become easier and easier to do.</p>
                <p>However, the problem is that this is often done without consent or even a notice to those being watched.</p>
                <p>With privacy not being a guranteed right, the law still has a long way to go if it yearns to catch up with the rapidly developing technology..</p>

                <h3>Concerns in Modern Society</h3>
                <p>American society has become more and more aware of the unconsented privacy invasions.</p>
                <p>Recent scandals such as the Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of how it affected American society. Data was collected via a survey distributed on Facebook of millions, and those data were then used to create election campaign ads in the USA for Donald Trump to target voters.</p>
                <p>All of this was done without any notice or consent by the American public through a process known as Data Mining.</p>

                    <p4>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify before Congress</p4>
                </div></center>
                <p>When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was questioned by Congress, it is obvious that our Congress members are not educated on the recent technology, which posed to be a huge threat to our democracy.</p>
                <p>This begs the question whether or not our Congress are truly competent in the future generations if nothing changes as in knowledge requirements.</p>
