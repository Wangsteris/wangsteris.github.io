                <h3>Mexican American War</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: Apr 25, 1846-Feb 2, 1848</p>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Intent</span>: To carry out the idea of Manifest Destiny and take California from Mexico.</p>
                <p>This war occured during a time period of American expansionism when the nation was acraze by the idea of Manifest Destiny and the idea of an empire that spanned from sea to shining sea. </p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: Under the leadership of American generals, the American army is able to take the Mexican capital and end the war. In the end, the Americans were able to take control of California. However, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was so that the United States will pay Mexico up to $20 million for the land.</p>
                <p>Even though the war demonstrated the American identity of their nationalism as evident in their almost craze in the idea of Manifest Destiny, there were still opposititons to going to war to acquire land. For example, when Polk attempted to use the idea that the Mexican army had opened fire on the American soldiers. However, he faced opposition from those such as Lincoln, who proposed the Spot Resolution.</p>
                <p>However, in the end, numerous American and Mexican soldiers died during the war. Even if the war isn't rightly justified as Polk had wanted people to believe, it is still an important part of American history as it shapes the nation as it developed.</p>
