                <h3>School Shootings</h3>
                <p>The recent abundance of school shootings has been widely reported by social media and news outlets.</p>
                <center><div class="container1">

                    </div>
                    <p4>According to a recent statistics, more students had died this year than active military personnels.</p4>
                </div></center>
                <h3>What Went Wrong?</h3>
                <p>Why are more students dying than combat personnels? What went wrong in our society and why is nothing being done to help it?</p>
                <p>That is because we have incompetent government officials running the country that only cares about their own personal gains.</p>

                    <p4>Texas Lt. Governor blames school shootings on schools having too many entrances. Are you kidding me?!</p4>
                </div></center>
                <p>We have complete morons running states that would do anything to not enforce stricter gun control laws.</p>
                <p>School shootings have become so prominent that the American public has become numb to it already. That is a sad reality since what developed country has such a high student death rate? This is a disgrace to the United States and the man who promised to make America Great Again isn't doing his job correctly.</p>
