                <h3>Internal Split</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: Apr 12, 1861-May 13, 1865</p>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Intent</span>: For the Union, it was to restore the Confederate states back into the Union. For the Confederacy, it was to prevent the Union from forcing them back into the Union and protect Slavery.</p>
                <p>This war is one of the darkest in American history. Family often split as their view points differed and brothers had to fight each other. In addition, with the Industrial Revolution bringing with it better technology, the war was brutal and casualties was high.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Death Tolls:</span> About 620,000. The most American deaths in all American wars.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: The war was brutal. The Union had thought the war would be a quick one. However, the first battle at Bullrun made them change their mind. When the first battle had ended, it was known that the war would be a tough one. The Confederacy initially had the advantage since they were defending and did not have to conquer the Union. However, as the war dragged on, they lacked supplies. The North had embraced the Industrial Revolution to a higher degree than the South, meaning they had the majority of all factories. In addition, the Union with its Anaconda Plan wanted to starve the Confederacy into a surrender.</p>
                <p>This event also freed the Slaves in certain areas with Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation following the Union victory at Antietam. This helped shape the American National identity by allowing the nation to advance towards equality and freedom for all.</p>
                <p>However, the events of this war must not be forgotten. The South was devastated by this war, especially through Sherman's March where all was burned and pillaged. It is an important piece of American hisotry and should not be viewed in a negative light.</p>
