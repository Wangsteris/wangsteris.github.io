                <h3>An Assembly of Demigods</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: May 27, 1787-Sep 17, 1787</p>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Intent</span>: To improve upon the Articles of Confederation, and create a style of central government that is fair and powerful. This was to be done through the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
                <p>Those present at the convention included people of the likes of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton. All in all, those that attended could be thought as the nation's best intellectuals at the time.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: The delegates from the different states and backgrounds engaged in days worth of heated discussion with each advocating policies that will benefit their own domestic region. In the end, the delegates were able to compromise, some examples being the 3/5 Compromise and the New Jersey Plan. Benjamin Franklin even stated that it was impossible for people of different backgrounds and faults to come up with something perfect and that he could not believe how close to perfection they were able to get.</p>
                <p>The Convention demonstrated the American and National identity of compromises and the ability to cooperate. During the time, many enemies of the young nation, namely the old monarchs of Europe, was waiting for the United States to fail. However, the delegates were able to prove them wrong by compromising and successfully pass the Constitution, demonstrating to the whole world that people of different regions and interests could work together.</p>
