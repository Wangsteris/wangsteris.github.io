                <h3>Declaration of Independence</h3>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Date</span>: July 4, 1776.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight3">Intent</span>: To declare the thirteen colonies to be no longer part of the British Empire and that they are their own independent nation in the form of the United States of America.</p>
                <p>Also known as the "Shout heard around the world". The declaration is a message from the American people about how they are unwilling to stand for abuses and oppression. It demonstrates the American spirit and nationalist identity. The United States thus shocked the world with their willingness to fight for their freedom against the world superpower at the time.</p>
                <p><span class="highlight1">Result</span>: Under the leadership of competent generals such as George Washington, the American Continenteal Army was able to overcome disadvantages such as a lack of supplies, lack of support, and a lack of allies in the Native Americans. This victory would go on to bolster the American identity and sense of nationalism as the Americans was able to defeat the almost invincible British Army.</p>
